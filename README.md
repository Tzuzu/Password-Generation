## What I've Learned

I've learned a few things about this assignment, some I will definitely need to keep messing around with to make it stick.

- I kept running into errors because I was doing things out of order, so I had to fix my code and make it work from top to bottom in order to make things work
- Understanding how for loops work in order to randomly select an item out of a group
- JavaScript is still insanely difficult to me, so I'll likely have to take on other projects in order to become more efficient in it.
